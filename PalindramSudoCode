"A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward"
For example: radar or madam
Your task is to design an optimal algorithm for checking whether a given string is palindrome or not!

Pseudocode
First, we need to consider the type of value.
If it is a number, we need to change it to a string to compare how it reads backwards and forwards.
If it is an object, we need to somehow also change it to a string to do a comparison.
If it is a string, we can forge ahead.
If we have null or undefined, how do we handle that?
